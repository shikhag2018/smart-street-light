# smart-street-light
It's a hardware project in which ldr sensor senses the day or night condition, and accordingly tells the microcontroller to on/off the light 
when it's day light is off, and when it's night light turns on automatically,and also their is fault detction system using current sensor
when light gets faulty it shows 1 on the graph.I used thingspeak platform in this project to send the data.
